    region_code:

        Spatial reference code from the provider.
        For Landsat region_code is a scene path row:
                '{:03d}{:03d}.format(path,row)'
        For Sentinel it is MGRS code.
        In general it is a unique string identifier
        that datasets covering roughly the same spatial
        region share.
